### Installing MEERA

To install MEERA:

1. Clone this repository on local machine.
2. `cd` to project root folder.
3. Run `chmod +x meera.sh`
4. Run `./meera.sh install` to install all dependancies.
5. Run `./meera.sh train` to train ML models
6. Search and replace API keys in all *.ini.example files (See *Properties to be Replaced* below)
7. rename all `*.ini.example` files to `*.ini`
8. Run `./meera.sh start` to deploy the application.

### Usage

Once MEERA is installed on your system, you can start using MEERA from command line utility. Following are the commands supported:

#### Supported Commands


    Usage: ./meera.sh [command [optional parameters...]]

    Supported commands:

    clean               : cleans the project directory
    install             : installs project
    lint                : checks for compile time errors
    train [iterations]  : trains ML models. Optional parameter: # of iterations. Default value is 50
    evaluate            : evaluates ML models
    test                : runs tests
    start               : starts the deployment
    help                : help on supported commands

Here is what each of the above commands do:

* **clean**

  deletes pycache folders, log directory virtual environemnt and generated models. Once you clean the project directory, you will need to repeat installation procedure, before next usage.

* **install**
  
  sets up virtual environment and installs dependencies.

* **lint**
  
  scans for any compile time errors in the python scripts.

* **train [iterations]**

  trains machine learning models based on `*.utterance` files in project directory. This command take optional parameter, number of iterations of training for each model. If no value is passed, default number of iterations are 50.

* **evaluate**
  
  evaluates each machine learning model based against data in `*.utterance` files.

* **test**
  
  runs tests in `/tests` folder.

* **start**

  deploys MEERA and starts telegram daemon.


This repository provides an implementation of telegram bot that can be used to interact with MEERA. One needs to [create a telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot), and add the bot token to `interface/telegram_bot/telegram.ini.example` file for bot to function.

### Definitions

COMING SOON

### Communication with Clients

MEERA exposes a WebSocket API for communication with clients. This API consist for 5 different messages which are exchanged as json objects.

COMING SOON

### Debugging API

MEERA also exposes following REST endpoints for debugging purpose

1. **Client Endpoint**
   
        path: /clients
        response:
       	   [
               {
                   "id": ...,
                   "name": ...,
                   "type": ...,
               },
               ...
           ]

2. **Conversation Endpoint**

        path: /conversations
        response:
            [
                {
                    "conversationId": ...,
                    "contexts": [...]
                },
                ...
            ]

3. **Context Endpoint**
        
        path: /context/{contextId}
        response:
            {
                    // context object
            }

### Building a Plugin

COMING SOON

### Architecture

MEERA banks on various components that communicate with each other through exchange of events. Following figure shows various components of MEERA interacting with each other.
